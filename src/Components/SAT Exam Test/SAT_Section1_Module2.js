Researchers are investigating this feat partly to learn more about humans’ comparatively limited abilities to regenerate, and they’re making exciting progress. An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration. <br><br>  <b> Text 1: </b> <br> When Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement.
